# Myde Soft

Myde Soft is a lightweight, integrated accounting and information management system designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses. The software is built from the ground up without using heavy external libraries, resulting in a very small size (under 5 MB) and high performance. It supports multiple users and devices with role-based permissions, provides secure cloud-based data backup and remote sales monitoring, and does not require Microsoft Excel to be installed despite using Excel-based data storage.

Myde Soft is continuously updated with new and practical features to meet the evolving needs of small and medium retail shops.

## Technical Description (for Developers)

Myde Soft is a lightweight desktop-based accounting and information management system engineered for small and medium-sized retail environments. The application is developed entirely from scratch without relying on heavy third-party libraries, resulting in a compact binary size of under 5 MB and high runtime performance.

The system utilizes an Excel-based data storage layer for fast local read/write operations while abstracting file handling so that Microsoft Excel is not required on the host machine. It supports multi-user and multi-device environments through a role-based access control (RBAC) model, ensuring secure separation of responsibilities.

Myde Soft integrates automated cloud synchronization to enable real-time or near–real-time remote monitoring of sales and operational data by administrators. The architecture is designed to function reliably in low-resource and unstable network conditions, with ongoing updates focused on performance, security, and feature expansion.
